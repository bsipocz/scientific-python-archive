# Goals

The one-week-long developer summit provides an opportunity for ~30-50 core
developers from the scientific Python ecosystem to come together to:

- Improve joint infrastructure

  Join efforts and resources to adopt and improve infrastructre and
  processes that are used by projects across the board. These include
  infrastructure covered by SPECS protocols already, including but not
  limited to documentation, testing, packaging, and CI infrastructure.

  ```
  Re-usable libraries with commonly used functionality
  Shared build system for binary packaging
  Integrated websites and expanded documentation
  Shared benchmarking
  Developer Operations (DevOps)
  ```

- Better coordinate core projects

  Community best operating and development practices manual
  Coordinated release schedule
  Regular cross-project communication
  Joint governance structures

- Work on a shared developer roadmap

  Our community has never before engaged in a deliberative process to try and anticipate future challenges.  
  The strategic plan will identify core needs and future challenges of
  the scientific Python community. Rather than focusing on the technical details of one particular core project, the strategic plan would discuss the challenges shared by more projects. The plan will also be used by the community
  for support when applying for federal grants.

# Participants

We have funding to cover 40—no more than 50—participants for 5 days,
6 nights, including travel, food, and lodging.
